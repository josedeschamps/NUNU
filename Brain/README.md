# Bot
This is a bot that will buy a PS5 through Walmart. It's written in python and uses selenium to interact with web pages. It's a very simple program that uses recursion to prevent the code from crashing from running faster than the webpage. 

## Installment
I decided to remove the release. Please just run the code on an IDE of your choice as I try to improve the program
